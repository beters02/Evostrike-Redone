# Evostrike
 [Evostrike](https://www.roblox.com/games/11287185880/Evostrike-BETA) is a multiplayer FPS game for Roblox, deeply inspired by the Source Engine.
 Programming and engine work done by myself, assets are all made by my little brother, [Donut](https://github.com/metr0nme)
 
## Features
- Custom movement with the goal of having the feeling of movement that is a mix between CSS and CSGO. I used [Fragsurf](https://github.com/Olezen/UnitySourceMovement) as a reference
- Fine tuned recoil patterns to match that of CSGO and CS 1.6, which when combined with movement makes for a heavily mechanical tactical shooter
- Skins, knives, and cases
- A large codebase that support modding for gamemodes, weapons, movement, etc

This is my *baby*. Counter-Strike has long been a passion of mine, and I've always felt extremely motivated to become involved in it's development to better the game and community.
