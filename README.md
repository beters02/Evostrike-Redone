# Evostrike
 [Evostrike](https://www.roblox.com/games/11287185880/Evostrike-BETA) is a multiplayer FPS game made in Roblox Studio, which is deeply inspired by Source Engine.
 Programming and engine work done by myself, as well as some of the maps. Assets are all made by my little brother, [Donut](https://github.com/metr0nme)
 
## Features
- Custom source-based movement with the main goal of having movement that feels like a mix between CSS and CSGO. I used [Fragsurf](https://github.com/Olezen/UnitySourceMovement) as a reference
- Fine tuned recoil patterns to match that of CSGO, which when combined with the source movement, makes for a heavily mechanical tactical shooter that is rewarding to master
- Skins, knives, and cases
- A large codebase that supports modding for gamemodes, weapons, movement and more

This is my *baby*. Counter-Strike has been a passion of mine for a long time, and it's my dream to become professionally involved with something related to CS or Source Engine.
