The game is already starting to feel very messy and therefore I feel like
we need to make a system for objects to make everything uniform and organized.

Types:

Module = A ModuleScript that contains more than 1 functions.
Class = A ModuleScript that returns a class.
Function = A ModuleScript that contains only 1 function.

PlayerModule = Player-Related Module Scripts (Weapon, Ability)
PlayerFunction = Player-Related Module Scripts that contain only 1 function

Classes:

GameObject = Any object that can be found within the game framework. (Modules, Folders, )

Three main trees are:

Server
Contains Server only access GameObjects.

Client
Contains Client only access GameObjects.

Shared
Contains shared access GameObjects.
